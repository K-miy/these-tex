     WTA. In its most general form, static WTA is known to be NP-Complete. A more difficult problem results when the numbers and locations
     of targets are not known a priori. Typically, constraints on the weapons maneuverability and range require a sequence of partial assignments
     at times t1, t2, ..., tk, where at each ti, a subset of the n targets are known only stochastically. This dynamic WTA formulation
     may be modelled as a stochastic program (SP). In general, stochastic programs may be solved by decomposing the SP into a sequence of
     deterministic problems. However, for dynamic WTA, the integrality and non-linearity of the problem makes it difficult to obtain a solution by
     decomposition. This paper studies an algorithm that find an optimal for a similar problem which is close to optimal for the original

assignment of a set of platforms/weapons to a set of targets such that the overall expected
effect is maximized. In the present study, we extend the basic WTA problem by allowing for
multiple target assignments per platform, subject to the number of weapons available and
their effectiveness. We formulate the problem as a linear integer programming problem
and investigate two solution methods. The first method is a greedy approach based on the
sequential application of the auction algorithm that was generalized for assigning n
assets/resources to m targets. The second method is built on a branch-and-bound
framework that enumerates feasible tours of assets/resources  a process that can
become computationally intensive with increasing number of sources and targets but will
find an optimal solution. We provide results of Monte Carlo experiments and provide
comparative evaluation of the two solution methods. Finally, we extend the branch-and-bound
technique to assigning multiple platforms per target and thereby demonstrate its
utility for collaborative asset planning. While this study focuses on weapon target pairing
for illustration purposes, the methods and results herein are readily applicable to sensor
tasking and similar resource allocation problems.",

    the following battle scenario. The offense launches a number of weapons (the targets) which are aimed at assets
    of the defense. These targets are assigned values by the defense. The defense has a number of (nonreusable)
    defensive weapons each of which can engage at most one target. The outcome of such an engagement is stochastic.

    targets so as to minimize the total expected value of the targets which survive all stages. In this study it is
    assumed that all targets have a value of unity and that the engagement of a target by a weapon depends only on
    the stage number. If the number of weapons used in each stage is linearly dependent on the number of targets,
    then it is shown that as the number of targets approaches infinity, the solution to this stochastic problem can

In the static Asset-Based WTA problem, the offense launches
missiles at valuable assets of the defense. The defense must assign
its weapons to these missiles so as to minimize the damage they
incur. In the dynamic version, this allocation is done in time
stages such that the outcomes of the previous engagements can
be used in making future assignments.

This report briefly describes the weapon-threat assignment problem. This is a special
case of the more general optimal resource allocation problem, which is an actual real-time
defence industry problem with a large number of military applications. It is indicated
how an appropriate simplified simulation model can be constructed. A previous study, that
solved the problem using a genetic algorithm, is briefly reviewed. No attempt is made to
solve the problem here. However, it is suggested that this problem is a good candidate
for the testbed that is required for the last part of the CALMA study, which will be a
comparative evaluation of the different optimization techniques that were studied and/or
developed in the earlier stages of this project. The outcome of this comparative study may

  formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem and is known to be NP-complete. There do not exist any
  exact methods for the WTA problem which can solve even small size problems (for example, with 20 weapons and
  20 targets). Though several heuristic methods have been proposed to solve the WTA problem, due to the absence

A tabu search heuristic then improves this tree through the removal or addition of defence actions, followed by
